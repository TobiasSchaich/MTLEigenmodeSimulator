# MTLEigenmodeSimulator
Calculates eigenmodes for up to 4 (coated) wires in a 2-D geometry.

## Introduction
This small app can simulate the bound eigenmodes of up to 4 wires (either coated or uncoated) and determine important characteristics such as normalised voltage, characteristic impedance, attenuation and phase constant. Simply run the GUI using the "EigenmodeCalculator" command. The app should be fairly self-explanatory. 

## Notes
The theoretical background for uncoated wires can be found [online](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0059393 'Go To Publication'). The theory for coated wires has not been published yet but will appear in my PhD dissertation and can be found on the University of Cambridge repository soon. 
I take no responsability for the accuracy of any of the results obtained from this program.
